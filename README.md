Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Wycliffe, a python developer, 
electrical power and electrical engineer 
and an aeronautical engineer.

Below are some of my favorite university projects,
which are interesting, but don't represent my current skills.
You might want to look at my resume instead: [link]([https://www.google.com](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VIJy44ZA3xvBcGhxmgsMEEnNeH5EOEbnXCu-EPfnA80/edit))
